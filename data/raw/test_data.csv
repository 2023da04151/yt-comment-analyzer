 don think that surprising that right leaning politicians win elections around half the time the yes obama was president from 2009 2017 but before that george bush was president for years and before clinton republicans won out presidential elections between 1968 and 1988 these things tend back and forth like pendulum one side wins then takes things too far people put the other side charge for while the same most democratic countries different question but maybe the one you are really trying ask why immigration and nationalism have become hot button issues the last few years the 1990s and 2000s the right was more free market pro trade pro immigration because pro business but the last decade has because more nationalistic populist anti trade and anti immigration there are several explanations but every country going have different one for example europe has largely been driven the refugee crisis and the poor way that has been handled the various governments the began with the financial crisis and increase immigration under bush but has also been driven liberal overreach number social issues under obama top this you got social media replacing television the main way people get news that local incidents are often blown into national incidents would also note that both left and right the extremes are getting more attention you have sanders the facto leader democrats the corbyn the leader labour the melenchon doing quite well france etc ,1

bumrah fluid middle order don rule out playing lad who has had great year all formats for mumbai play the role rana did for them contrary the common opinion don see akila playing anywhere other than chepauk spent lot get rahul chahar and they have long history trust youngsters also not like bhajji played crucial role last year was dropped midway for karn sharma who was another unpopular bowler that time another point contention might mcc place fizz but don see that happening since was not really their initial plans rohit has said they would like keep the opening combo secret could open but with that middle order think will take upon himself play the role csk watson

wood fleming has made couple interesting statements that dhoni and jadeja will given more batting responsibility and that bhajji and karn are being looked upon allrounders playing overseas openers might look odd when they have vijay but think csk wants create that bmac dsmith partnership again and that why they didn for vijay initially the auction for their practice match form billings and shorey have been awesome plus faf might still suffering from the blow the last test against aus expect jadeja play higher than kedar considering can really bowl with that still injured shoulder and his vijay hazare form shardul has been atrocious the practice games with billings taking him apart but csk don really have another option maybe chahar but they might not him straightaway gambhir

stokes
buttler
gowtham
gopal
archer
kulkarni
unadkat the only point contention whether play short klassen while having middle order klassen stokes and buttler sounds great don think will straight that short was the designated backup for smith should play also his problems against spin are really overstated just doesn strike against spin well against pace that not like gets too often spin and the guys thinking binny will play ahead gowtham will not don really have much squad depth but their first the best the tournament kkr narine

kuldeep going practice match form rinku confirm starter plus gill waste below nagarkoti was taken apart russell the practice game but will still pip mavi more complete cricketer better batsman much better fielder and going the statements made venky think they will give both the bowlers lot games over vinay many people are thinking they can play both leaving out chawla they might still start with this srh dhawan
hales
kane
pandey
saha
shakib
hooda tanmay
rashid
bhuvi
kaul
thampi brathwaite bowled well their practice games but with warner gone and kane captain hard see him play since both hales and kane have play now saha and tanmay both batted extremely well that too hard leave tanmay after that hooda gives that extra spin bowling option but hasn really been the good books srh for the pace bowling they can choose any kaul thampi sandeep khaleel but think this will the starting lineup their middle order has too many bats with 120 rcb bmac
kohli
abd
sarfaraz cdg
woakes
sundar
umesh
saini
chahal don agree with this lineup but this what likely vettori loves bmac qdk sits out and plays the wicketkeeping duties rest the lineup fills itself then imo qdk and kohli should open with abd and pavan deshpande the middle order kxip mayank
karun yuvi
finch
miller
stoinis
axar
ashwin
tye
mohit with ashwin difficult predict what will happen but this might the most sane lineup out their squad has said will use yuvi bowler more there that still lack bowling options imo they might leave karun out for sran don scratch anything out considering ashwin ",1

 all are absolutely stupid you think that was nothing here the narrative that pakistan has put out far indian jets entered our territory and got beaten back our jets they dropped payload but missed and there was nothing hit anyways then show that too can infiltrate india sent our jets which none were f16s and dropped minor payloads open spaces and not any military civilian installation then indian jets entered our territory and shot down jet and captured pilot the fact that have recovered weaponry which only used f16s thus shows that the above was lie they lied about not using f16s they lied about the not targeting military installations hitting military installations act war they lied about the number planes they shot down and the number our pilots they captured keep mind the air vice marshal stated that they had evidence for balakot strikes well but the govt decided not release maybe they only killed terrorists and the government wants save face with all the lies that pakistan has said why hard believe that they lied about the other stuff like balakot well wouldn the first time far thought pakistan had the upper hand diplomatically speaking they were ahead goi and already had narrative place narrative which convinced least part lot people here including myself but this changes everything imran khan said that they weren conducting any military operations and wanted peace then why did they send f16s plane they are only supposed use against terrorists against and targeted military installations understand the statements the press conference were bit jarring with all the talk about being ready but the move set wing commander abhi free was clearly not expected anyone thats why they delayed the press conference they also didnt say whether was act war because our country doesn want the first declare war thats where this headed also absolutely believe the avm when said they have more evidence its tactical move not release now case pakistan lies again can use the previous few hours were uneventful but the next few are definitely going interesting the ball pakistan court now lets see what happens edit just clarify not warmongering fearmongering was just stating the facts and explaining why the evidence the iaf provided crucial sincerely hope find peaceful and diplomatic way end this edit some people claiming that the amraam also used the jf17 will have more research and confirm this still doesn change the fact that they targeted military installations ,1

politicians are usually very subtle about how they about moulding public opinion these days more blatant but then partisanship has also increased you look how they pushed through regulations and how they are eroding our fundamental rights scary thing the supreme court recently said that the fundamental freedoms are not absolute and the state can take away this the most alarming thing that have ever heard this means that they can challenge and even end the freedom religion press speech assembly against exploitation etc the core values our nation and constitution was based this could mean that religion becomes part the government and politics not good mix theocracies are the least free countries out there and the most regressive the problem with the current government how they are using rhetoric divide the country more than anything else they called entire universities anti national they doctored videos show student leaders bad light they made people stand for national anthems theaters enforcement being infringement our rights too used the political machinery stifle dalit voices attacked the patriotism everyone who opposed them used the armed forces political tool shamed people for complaining about being unable access their hard earned money because poor government policy invoking soldiers two their states have passed strict conversion laws tried incite violence kerala among other states passed beef ban creating aura fear encouraged vigilantism thereby undermining the power police and judiciary pretty much endorsing bullying coercion and fearmongering have insulted and harassed and villified intellectuals scientists reformists rationalists journalists and activists thereby stifling free speech and also causing harm the ones exercising the problem not just doing these things but also forming public opinion that these are the right things making people themselves forgo their fundamental rights unknowingly this erodes the constitution and our democratic framework and dangerous for the nation this how fascist and authoritarian states like franco spain mussolini italy and ergodan turkey trump america and putin russia were formed not desirable outcome ,-1

see every religion old and archaic but some points which trouble are follows not generalising the community the religion terrorists belonging lashkar toiba and hizbul mujahideen get mass funerals attended thousands people terrorist who was gunned down the security forces the valley received gun salute from fellow militants midst mourners these mourners were ordinary villagers who had come mourn the death terrorist belonging group coordinating with qaeda support for yakub memon this something which rankled the core was still bearable for burhan wani get support because was phenomenon one extremity the country but the massive amount people who gathered for yakub funeral was scary because was much further into the mainland don think that terror convict who has been hanged the supreme court for orchestrating communal bomb blasts the part the company now allied with the haqqani network deserves such funeral support for zakir naik this one uncomfortable but troubling aspect zakir naik aggressive minion who harps belittling other religions proclaim his faith superiority over the rest has advocated death for apostates support for sexual slavery and support for osama apart from being fast talking charlatan who lies pulls out fictious names out nowhere while denying evolution among host other things actually quite dangerous and has been accused inspiring the dhaka terror attackers now would certainly understand this guy were fringe but enjoys widespread popularity much that parties such the iuml and the aimim came support him focus far away international events while ignoring nearer problems home was reading wiki article the iranian election protests 2009 against alleged vote rigging the authorities support ahmadenijad today while scrolling down the article saw the various cities where protests were held most were inside iran while some were cities where there were sizeable number iranian diasporas naturalised iranian citizens but among all those cities was hyderabad too indian hyderabad don yet understand this why did some people hyderabad feel attached the elections iran that they protested against the results what are the priorities why does event quarter way across the world hold sway why similarly just don understand why there were riots azad maidan due events myanmar myanmar india ofcourse not why were there riots you see buddhist groups rioting india because they persecuted malaysia you see the hindu groups rioting because the hindus are oppressed pakistan the same way you see the christians rioting the same way because they oppressed pakistan partition this was horrific event what important that the muslim majority provinces india had muslim league governments power most the eligible voters was based limited franchise voted for the muslim league why that most the muslim voters undivided india voted for the muslim league while most the hindu voters ditched the communal hindu mahasabha vote for the congress which was largely secular this isn focused india but nevertheless have you heard the undhr its global consensus based charter basic principles focused highlighting basic human rights which should enjoyed each and every human regardless their identities its ideals are lofty and universal now have you heard the cairo declaration human rights was charter made and signed almost all members the organisation islamic countries was made opposition the unhdr which was condemned the oic members being based judeo christian values firstly ironical them oppose the unhrd because they based judeo christian values isn moses prophet islam isn jesus prophet islam why are the oic countries opposed the norms which are allegedly derived from the values which these prophets valued and practiced secondly and importantly the cairo declaration seemingly restricts the rights non muslims and declares shariat being the source law making note there other parallel cdhr nations belonging other religions such hinduism and buddhism question the whole world finds the unhdr lofty and ideal then why the muslim majority states have problem with much they were forced create restrictive alternative how you justify religious rule our history replete with muslim kings being harsh towards non muslims curtailing their rights compared muslims while the past past don understand why some these potentially divisive figures are marketed being the paragons tolerance some members the community for example aurangzeb considered mujhadid islamic reformer who saved amd rejuvenated islam some you think that figure divisive this being looked upto good guy step towards good relations ofcourse not edit why did the pew poll 2003 show majority indonesia tolerant country supporting osama confidence osama poll 2005 showed osama support pakistan the poll was held just the aftermath instead anger and resentment there was approval osama the opinions these states pakistan and indonesia dropped turned against him only after started targeting the civilians the muslim majority countries why was high the first place just because americans indians spainards and the french were attacked aren these humans just like the rest edit why are muslims states such and the the least integrated community the considered the western world christian fundamentalism citadel and yet overall going polls christians are rather marginally better terms accepting socially progressive views why that the muslim community appears the bottom the list measuring social progression everywhere you have seen this across the atlantic and france ,1

 una questione più principio che sostanza proprio per questo tutte strumentalizzazioni della lega soci non hanno senso anche una cosa che non viene mai detta cioè che legge prevede anche periodo transitorio sei mesi per poter essere applicata anche retroattivamente chi avrebbe avuto diritto passato per cui ora sarebbe troppo tardi esempio pratico lyngrin russa figlia genitori russi vive italia quando anni ora fatto tutte scuole italia regola col permesso soggiorno avendo ottenuto quello permanente cui comunque arrivata dopo diversi rinnovi quello tempo che pure costicchiano una certa cifra qualche centinaio euro alla volta non stessa procedura sarebbe necessaria anche per gli attuali destinatari della legge non può ancora richiedere cittadinanza perché unica via sarebbe attualmente quella per anni residenza continuativa servono anche anni continuativi reddito superiore agli 600€ circa che non riuscita metter ulteriore beffa anno scorso era riuscita completare primo anno ora siamo trasferiti lei non trova lavoro quest anno resterà sotto soglia dunque dovrà ricominciare come risultato ciò dovuto rinunciare concorso per forestale che stato suo sogno sin bambina effetto immediato della legge sarebbe proprio queste persone oltre che quelli che oggi sono bambini coloro che dopo aver vissuto gran parte della propria vita italia vedrebbero finalmente riconosciuti loro cittadinanza edit fatemela dire una cosa anche politica lega che oggi difende nazione quando ieri cantava vesuvio lavali col fuoco roma ladrona schifo ,1

people don seem understand this this anger and violence that you are seeing now has been there since before this government came power the majority decided vote block because they weren happy with the policies the previous government congress scams was one reason but the deal breaker was minority appeasement before 2014 ensuring the minorities voted block while dividing the majority vote was the way elections were won every party had their own minority block the hindus somehow got frustrated with this and decided vote block just like the minority and they decided vote for the bjp that why the bjp won 2014 landslide wasn promises development that got the bjp votes was the fact that the bjp was the only party that seemed appease the majority their history was such that the majority hindus felt comfortable with the bjp power rather than the congress when the bjp won they got emboldened because they saw the the kind power the majority hindus wield indian politics now they think that their turn pandered they aren scared because this government does not pander the minorities anymore this why violence the majority visible now ,1

 few bad people does bad thing entire community suffers the consequences humans are well known stereotype people and categorize people their minds based what they think those category people doesn have right all yet people are stupid enough that for example many people categorize women into separate category and stereotype them into thinking women should only this are expected xyz thing another example men must not cry now those were categorization based gender now there are categorization based all types things from skin color religion country wealth education job caste etc many people darker skin color still face discrimination lot countries example job based discrimination many people consider babas scamsters because several high profile babas getting into scandals that doesn mean there aren good babas out there doing real good work then criticize politicians singular category ohh politician must corrupt then criticize successful industrialists what jerk for having much wealth must have got cheating people all these categorization are bad and should not exist the ideal world but they people are stupid they make these things their mind you fall into any these categories then you suffer the consequences what other people with similar categories have done case muslims and hindus divide all started during the partition and the struggle after that millions people died people who survived will tell their children stories how evil that muslim hindu was who killed your grandpa this make the kids have distorted view the world where person that religion default huge boogeyman and due lack consistent interaction childhood the child grows with those thoughts his mind then each event which come across will categorize his mind ohh that person that religion did this this increases into hatred these issues get amplified someone that category does something really really bad which gets lot media attention this how feminists word for people advocating for equality gender suddenly started looking like negative word because actions few people who claimed feminist was bad that now people think all feminists are bad case muslims the current running stereotype around the world the association lot terrorist organizations with islam this makes people put people associate that with the stereotype sure there are terrorist organizations who are from other religions well but that not the point here people will see the attack and see the religion and just assume both are correlated together next time they come across someone who has those religion they becomes slightly suspicious the online world especially reddit where everyone anonymous these kinda suspicions get openly discussed and people become complete racists sexists and all other kind bad things have lot friends who are various religions including yours don care about religion care about what kinda person you are guess being someone from kerala also have something with this here did not have much inter religion struggle like what northern india had face during partition this means that people here generally not care about religion this means childhood where you get interact with people all backgrounds and thus such kinda hatred not there ,-1

 read answer quora but direct links aren allowed here just paste the answer here though the images the answer are lost also don agree with the answer completely but interesting counterpoint the general viewpoint have about hindutva question why did veer sawarkar form hindu mahasabha was atheist answer culture the physical manifestation individual spiritual immortality humans despite our mortal bodies crude natures flawed minds are luminous beings who can exist for millennia travel across oceans will and speak entire generations once under the right conditions for this one only one condition must met the individual must overcome their delusions mortality instead identify with immortal reality once that done all else follows the primary fallacy the average atheist makes the course their reading their belief that they somehow slipped off the chains religion delusion developed some sort individualistic freedom that nonsense the only thing they done exchange one set chains for another there absolutely difference between the rituals organized religion the flag marches communism for that matter liberal socialism there heaven religious liberal there was never any heaven merely duty never ending thankless duty part unknowing all knowing greater being with sense individual good evil even indifference that what the bhagavad gita actually says that what liberals don understand human beings want have part greater whole this sentiment the very basis humanity its civilizations its ethos religion like all ideologies merely another set lies meant justify the existence yet another unjust exploitative society because all societies their very collective existence are unjust exploitative the individual but that okay because human beings either want exploit exploited themselves even the holy liberals are bound their own set untruths and thus must constantly justifying arguing over group nonentities they not see that their stand absolute knowledge different from that adopted the christians muslims when they were persecuting being persecuted the pagans who preceded them there not single argument liberals have that hasn been raised ten thousand times earlier thomas aquinas lao tzu the buddha himself the mahabharata there not single argument the god delusion that hasn been discussed far more exhaustively dedicatedly comprehensively the tripitakas there isn single criticism the bible that wasn known countered thomas aquinas the individuals concerned thomas aquinas the buddha were not only far more intelligent learned enlightened than your liberal thinks they were all probability some the most intelligent beings grace this species the idea that they were foolish enough fall under some sort superstitious nonsense ridiculous they believe because choose chose order defend our chosen group the virtues sins this group whether this group christians hindus muslims even the people known certain circles sickulars don even figure this equation “for after all how know that two and two make four that the force gravity works that the past unchangeable both the past and the external world exist only the mind and the mind itself controllable – what then ” thus clearly see that the tribe the fundamental necessity well the ultimate goal human existence how this tribe defines itself called culture this culture turn can defined multiple factors race religion the communist manifesto the mein kampf nietzsche the god delusion course organized religion any tribe virtue the numerical superiority philosophical strength provides its members superior any number individuals thus dominates the latter through slaughter plunder therein lies the crux why the three great monotheistic faiths christianity islam judaism have destroyed virtually every single pagan faith the world save for india china paganism simply not robust enough ideology effectively bind people together too individualistic offers too many choices has too many freedoms don mistake freedom for the lack oppression murdering babies though that might been pure roman anti carthiginian propaganda burning widows which was the british digging nearly extinct traditions anti hindu propaganda are oppression but they not connote lack freedom the mere allowing choice within one spiritual thus cultural fabric paganism weakens the tribe thus paves the way for its own demise then why did india china survive the answer simple what the biggest factor that sets india china apart from the world and thus our hordes have given these two civilizations the immortality not even eternal egypt mighty rome could aspire like dragons outfought our pagan foes like monkeys cheated the mongol tumens like rats out bred our civilized monotheist oppressors thus survived but this state affairs could never continued for ever fertility rates fall schools open teach new lies place old ones people their eternal search for suffering hanker after new more horrifying tortures what people forget that leaving their religion they are effectively abandoning their own culture thus the very basis human civilization true they gain better softer society society more amenable individualistic bliss but such state affairs can only temporary before such hedonistic loosely bound members are swept away hard unthinking orthodoxy hindus long protected from the depredations islam christianity their vast population multifarious ethnic divisions warlike nature the early 1900s were open such culturalization thanks several events not under this answer purview thus was evident any well read indian the early 1900s that india concept was doomed extinction all said and done india hindu concept created hindus populated hindus defined hindus don give that secular nonsense hinduism like all indo european faiths does not correlate morality with divinity and thus shows tolerance for other religions unknown any faith currently existing earth yes even buddhism christians would got with their belief mythical jerusalem muslims would gone praying arab stone but india india are neither israel arabia and thus was born hindutva racial pride for made race one believed cultural pride for non existent culture land with millions civilizational pride for civilization that had long passed into legend fallen into barbarism religious pride for made religion that had carved out from the very forces meant oppose what savarkar being atheist real atheist unlike the anti national conformist phonies quora the indian liberals realized was that hinduism was unlikely survive for long merely account being pagan faith and with hinduism would gone the very essence india think yourself there are thousands dance traditions india how many them are islamic origin how many are christian origin how many ragas have the communists authored what good have the hordes the indian media done for humanity after one thousand years what good would bunch shouting news anchors have accomplished and yet play the same raga bhairavi the emperor samudragupta once played his veena thousand years before the first ship sailed around africa the same raga ustad bismillah khan performed every day the ghats varanasi until few years ago thus savarkar remade hinduism from christianity came the purpose violence militaristic organization from islam came the stress ideological purity defensiveness from judaism came the emphasis free enterprise racial religious existence the world oldest religion was reforged the very image the newest order withstand new crueller more ignorant humanity what did was different from what ataturk did when rebuilt new turkey form the ashes the ottoman porte when mao took the most bitter war torn people the world recast them into united china was nationalist everything did was for the nation for posterity judge his actions not but judge his intentions his character judged intellectual pygmies who haven had single original thought their own veer savarkar deserves better ,1

 was congress very late the social media game since 2014 bjp currently enjoys enormous dominance over social media narrative right now this changing how are you trying change how you plan combat the religious far right narrative social media bjp social media driven mostly either relgious far right hatred modi personality beyond social media how you plan combat hate politics rahul gandhi image has been painted succesfully bjp enormously negative and incompetent even not based reality how are you guys managing combat that for example rahul made many speeches many think tanks those speeches are not spread lot the social media team like this one found this chance when was searching for specific speeches and topics this hasn been publicized lot nationalism you think congress leaders should talk agressively pakistani deep state sponsorship terror know the views manish tewari surjewala because searched the statements their leaders but problem visibility this should repeated again and again their statements are not getting enough limelight nationalism rahul gandhi has indeed praised the iaf strikes and others which the positive step but after that the fog war bjp makes unsubtantiated statement 400 dead random congress leaders questions bjp brands you anti national equating questioning this questioning the indian air force bjp indeed dangerously politicizing the airstrikes but congress falling into the trap taking their bait seems congress falling into the bait bjp most common people not really care about minute details spice 2000 spice 250 most people don care the narrative what congress losing domestic politics international media doesn fight elections here what you think omar abdullah advice the opposition the more you talk about economy and jobs less you have talk about anti national national the opposition parties need switch tracks deny the the space politicise the recent terror attack air strikes the way keep the messaging focused the economy rural distress unemployment agriculture all the other things bjp doesn’ want discussed every time talk about pulwama balakote leave the door wide open for the the bjp play their strengths front their home audience logic would dictate switch strategies make them play our strengths now here another article omar retweeted which says modi has failed many issues but winning the narrative falling into every trap modi setting for them 2004013 some food for thought what you think the ideal way approach this congress willing shift tracks omar put the mahagatbandhan what congress strategy creating narrative for the party the opposition here seems bjp tying more alliances from shiv sena aiadmk for simply boils down two things either there prepoll alliance there not there will come under upa there not then possible that there will post poll alliance then why the need campaign together and the same stage you don put common candidate from each constituency the opposition mega rallies seem only benefit non congress parties the called mahaghatbandan the grand alliance really that much different from nda upa can congress clarify approach alliances modi creating simply narrative you are with you are with khichdi what congress simple message 2014 and rethinking rahul gandhi had said that congress leaders had gotten arrogant the end years upa which was one cause the downfall congress how does the congress message look back upa you say openly you made mistakes but the party has moved improved itself introspected the faults have you thought new name for alliance you win like replacement upa mark symbolic new beginning twitter there lot hate speech and fake news twitter bjp parlimaentary leaders summoned jack dorsey after twitter india suspended hate speech peddler squintneon abvp member from assam who posted posts mocking and celebrating the death dalit student rohith vermula his account was then promoted smiti irani twitter panelists are invited will congress able highlight the core cause this twitter hoopla bigot from abvp mocking suicide and being supported smiriti irani congress should publicize this direct support for this man parliament should also ask about twitter handling rampant fake news and hate speech twitter bjp again created the narrative jack dorsey snubs india based this one temperoriliy deletion hate speech supporter congress should highlight this incident bjp trying appropriate ambedkar and talk dailt rights but leaders are supporting such hatemongerers but twitter narrative jack dorsey who personally doesn know much sweeping this under the rug that know very long questions but these are important topics and congress would benefit from this discussion takes the right lessons ,1

 realise everyone hates hearing told you but now that are venting for while might well party that jerks off religion nationalism and army perform electorally did not keep their promises development and better law and order didn see this going any other way since the election day stroking feelings tribalism and fear coded into humans evolution the most intellectually lazy way gain power and yet very effective there also nothing original about which country the world does not have that right wing party that targets group people scapegoats and tells the majority that they are the reason for their problems you might willing apathetic people who are not you and make deal with the devil and overlook their authoritarianism and give some your freedoms and morals exchange for the promise economic prosperity but the end and may say justly you end having neither ,1
there clearly lesser two evil when you look the top level one party gave world renowned economist the prime minister while other gave wanna dictator chaiwala one party allowed cbi investigate them while other openly fired director many times for investigating them one party president incompetent man while other party president charged with murder exortion etc and gone jail well one party doesn label its opposer anti national terrorist but other does one party doesn cripple the media like the other one one party doesn invade institution with incompetent cronies while other does all the above points doesn even include communal voilence suppression free speech etc under current government ,-1

 been closely following the news the claims the debunking claims etc and think that have theory what exactly happened the air engagement that let the indian pilot capture first all though you need bear mind that war government military including india and pakistan always speaks 100 truthfully for different reasons they actually believe that what they are saying correct the time that they said this especially true air air combat where every war history all sides claim have shot down more planes than were actually shot down air combat can confusing due the speeds and distances involved they are trying protect military operational secrets tell lies publically order maintain military secret good example this was the 1991 gulf war where the and saudi kept claiming that almost all the iraqi scud missiles were successfully intercepted patriot missiles order get iraq stop trying fire the missiles the reality was that the patriots only hit minority incoming missiles they know that don know the truth for sure but with whatever information they have that information helps with the morale their own fighting forces and civilians this why for example ww2 many pilots would get credit the kills they claimed even when solid proof was missing with that said what know about the aerial engagement pakistan said that indian planes chasing its retaliatory strike entered pakistani space initially pakistan claimed planes were shot down one pilot custody and one hospital pakistan later officially changed that one plane mig and one pilot india agreed that they chased the strike said immediately that they were chasing 16s and claimed have shot down one them pakistan denied using 16s the operation said was 17s india then days later claimed they had electronic signatures data indicating 16s were involved and then produced wreckage from amraam aim 120 missile saying that 16s are the only planes south asia than can fire that missile now lets look the actual evidence mig shot down solid proof photos and video the wreck and pilot evidence 2nd indian plane shot down evidence but pakistan officially stopped claiming this shot down evidence all the photo evidence india claimed has now been proven false third party experts 16s involved the aim 120 wreckage pretty damning initial claims that was sold taiwan have been denied taiwan and based experts have said that the overall sale package that include the missile covered both taiwan and pakistan the missile likely have been sold pakistan however the aim 120 long range missile over 100km mile range and not missile that pakistan would use close range encounter like the one that india claimed occured india said they fired heat seeking missiles which has 30km mile range the amraam very unlikely have been fired from the information saying that the could fire them very old from around 2008 and all recent information says that they only fire the chinese version the missile instead amraam could not fired from plane with chinese radar like the does missiles are compatible only with the radar systems they were built for how you reconcile all this theory which fits the available evidence below pakistan had plan retaliate dropping bombs indian kashmir mission profile 17s strike element crossing into indian airspace 16s were used long distance escort using long range aim 120 missiles from safely deep inside pakistani airspace 17s dropped bombs just before the indian migs were interception range they turned round and burned hard for pakistani space the mig 21s chased them hard and are faster than 17s almost catching them before hitting the border the indian wing commander made the call hot pursuit that brought them range fire missiles 17s used flares evade the missiles but since the missiles still detonated close enough the pakistani planes that looked like kill the indian pilots the from distance looks lot like and could visually confused more this later but the same time once the indians were pakistani space the 16s range fired least one amraam taking out mig either wreckage from that missiles was carried into india inertia more likely second amraam missed its target perhaps because the second mig was diving away while using countermeasures and ended india why pakistan initially though got planes kill and then one missile fired resulting the target rapidly losing altitude and why india thought got kill also explains why the amraam part ended india and explains why pakistani denied the use 16s not trying give away that they use long range amraam missiles cover the escape strike planes the indian plane that got away would have brought with electronic data showing that was getting painted the kind radar that the carries this together with the easy confuse misidentification the with would have led india convinced that they were only fighting 16s and not 17s like they actually were for the issue why pakistan initially claimed one pilot custody and one hospital that simple ispr the time had pieces information work into immediate press release the time pakistan claimed have shot down planes indian pilot was reported have been taken into custody indian pilot was hospital getting treated the time ispr had make statement was not clear them that the indian pilot taken into custody was then taken hospital and was thus the same pilot they reported hospital since they thought there were different indian pilots that fitted well with the claims they had the time planes being shot down ,1

bjp different from other political parties india when comes shoutfests and posturing the media when they are opposition and compromising when they come power also believe that any political party should pragmatic their approach and stands have changed according situation turn today would have been the wrong turn years ago another point noted that modi was not the helm bjp when many these statements were made his personal stand might have been different and since power has the ability change these sees fit still there are many disappointing turnarounds that said here take since promised the major hangup according the article before was regarding the guarantee supply and tracking nuclear fuel indo french deal ece has pretty much guaranteed lifetime supply for french reactors what this would mean that other nations would have follow suit will lose out against the french henderson brooks major fuck they should make public but believe there are few major bomb shells there that making the govt hesitant the same hold trues for subhas chandra bose fiasco well aggressive posturing for vote bank but the basic theme has not changed calling sharif for inauguration was good move gave diplomatic leverage pakistan issue something have live with only thing government can increase covert ops strengthen intelligence and speed arms procurement something parrikar has been doing quite right after years fuckups afspa still effect its draconian law and should used the right proportions the after article mentions that bjp will govern such way that afspa will longer needed turn here they never advocated for permanent afspa see the major issue raised bjp during that timeframe opposition was that they did not take the opposition into confidence secondly the illegal immigration from bangladesh has reached its heights bjp wants cut down that and dealing with exclaves the first step that process retarded oppose opposition definite turn that would support uma bharti talked about years you look the years plan talks about short term changes years medium term next years and long term next years there are things happening the ground level example phase clean ganga campaign completed 201 html definite turn and something don like aadhar and uid has been badly managed but the other option let the 1000s crore spent the project pragmatic approach would have been audit check the discrepancies the system modi was against not giving fitting reply ceasefire this time around the response was not something mild 1272821 aspx has bjp said anything about not giving delhi full statehood whats the turn here bjp supported the old bill and wanted changes that 2015 they are proposing new bill with changes that they see fit will reply the rest later you fill them ,1

this very good stuff thank you for taking the time post here all the points you raised and the discussion points this thread have with government investment know this necessary but not the full picture there needs very strong emphasis removing excessive laws and regulation take your point raising revenues for the government you have listed five but there unthinkably large number activities people could only starting and running businesses didn involve interacting government officials second third tier towns the government can just provide basic services roads water internet millions small business owners could relocate out choked cities and spur local growth the opportunities are endless consider the city mysore under the classification the five would pretty much fall squarely under tourism but the government could give better power more reliable communications and better roads bangalore could very easily transformed into hub the revenues that come out the ecosystem will far exceed any the original five categories ,1

imo india has been reeling under this silent emergency for quite some time now all ruling politicians have mastered doublespeak and are afraid criticizing the govt even when its the wrong media state very biased and does not report extensively about things which can land government trouble recently modi had rally jaipur and all party workers were tasked fill the stands they paid people attend the rally show the support commands usual modi launched few schemes and told how now have acche din and the controlled crowd cheered two days prior rally sale black cloth was banned jaipur they feared protests from various groups nobody the media showing the ground reality now have government which believes looking good rather than doing good they have already given hints for their strategy 2019 openly declaring parliament that the opposition can try think removing them 2024 people are brainwashed with their propaganda that they give excuses like congress ruled for years should atleast give bjp years bjp might corrupt but modi not modi has made proud overseas what they dont understand that modi and his coterie has been lying through their teeth openly and misleading the nation this chest thumping culture propagating lies the norm now someone rightly said that democracy people get the leaders they deserve this puts thing into perspective majority the country still supports corruption and getting their job done regardless rules the onus vote out this government choosing for candidates who can bring some change rather than spinning tales during 2002 riots one modi regret was not managing media very well has aptly learned from his mistake and now have country where people are lynched due fake news real issues are swept under the carpet media silenced and nobody gives shit ,1

most bjp doing from what have heard jaat lawyers were peaceful and were attacked others these others were probably the obc brigade and were sent rajkumar saini that resulted the first fight which wasn much violent some chairs were thrown around and few people were injured nothing serious after this some jaat students were beaten their hostels electricity was cut and the students were beaten pretty brutally these students went other jaats telling them that students were getting beaten while the were sitting around this boiled jaat blood and stirred them into action the protestors got violent and top off the police shot people before using lathicharge tear gas which really fucked the situation that what know could rumour could true and also the media pretty biased their coverage ,-1

why everyone saying that india should war with pakistan not that simple sounds there are lot diplomatic issues involved even war declared not without bloodshed both the sides pakistan has large enough army give good fight they decide fight back that india victory not guaranteed and stop with the bulls like russia will support india china will support pakistan this not some classroom fight with countries choosing the sides which they want even the war breaks out will trigger domino effect and will eventually lead ww3 stop speculating start thinking logical sense war not the answer instead diplomatic war would best bet weaken pakistan try sanction them cut off their supply lines thank you for reading expecting lot downvotes just putting voice out ,1

 had commented this another similar thread few days ago here are reasons vote for rahul gandhi decent human being leader having some sense humility and inherent kindness great quality imho not the pappu the bjp wants believe like everyone else also fell for the bjp propaganda but the truth when watched some his interactions with people town hall style especially the bangalore ones genuinely felt that his goals are larger interest our people and clear about that plz watch his press conference bangalore today and you know pappu not takes press conferences and gives interviews ours democracy where leaders should asked questions without fear and they must face the independent press government not one man show the congress has relatively much better talent pool than the bjp like his thinking about respecting our differences caste creed religion etc basically believer unity diversity don claim that the perfect leader for our country but will surely take chances dynast and his party has image being corrupt but still better than the morally bankrupt crass communal and divisive leader the bjp and his party edit let also confess that had voted for the bjp the 2014 elections first time voter that time 2017 gujarat assembly elections voted for the congress and 2019 general elections will the same ,1

the traditional right left narrative doesn hold true for india right doesn ask for special treatment exclusive only hindus ask for equal treatment all citizens and modi has been party worker all his life even not still party worker doing his part for the country while rahul gandhi born with silver spoon and when asked about his constituency work told the peopel off saying can anything and ask the even otherwise what are his credentials mla these self appointed idiots who call themsleves gaurakshaks don represent the right and finally are you from the southern states and have never suffered have got our culture destroyed invaders they way rest india has think this the reason incidents like the gujarat riots happened may seem silly for thaf they fight over religion but there real suffering and fear behind their actions alienating them not gonna work well only end with idiot like trump then need bring them into the fold and correct their ways ,-1

absolutely true there are few more things that should included when looking his appeal firstly his strongman image india and also worldwide there trend towards people who make brash provocative statements being seen strong leaders trump for instance considered his supporters stronger leader than obama though the latter actually carried out more deportations and got osama killed modi takes step further and combines with bold not necessarily good initiatives like demo and the recent air strikes against pakistan now well known that demo was complete failure and what the air strikes actually achieved terms strategic objectives unclear best but from political perspective country like india these are brilliant moves after demo people were saying idea was good only implementation was bad though implementation optional component the govt responsibilities and not the most important component course the idea itself was insane but let not there this has led the least doing something syndrome despite the fact that previous govts also have done something yet that perception has been created and modi excellent spotting this key differentiator that why the govt keeps harping about nehru and other past and dead pms that why every bjp shill keeps parroting the white lie that nothing happened years combine that with the notion that everything the has done historic even when essentially rebranded existing initiatives but his greatest trump card was and will always rahul gandhi not only because that man walking gaffe machine fair modi but modi has carefully created media network that will suppress this fact the real problem with raga and his sister they are boy scout politicians raga seems have forgotten that the three state elections were not the thumping inc victories that were expected the inc won them very narrowly all modi needed turn the tide was major national crisis modi being political genius quickly seized upon pulwama even person who intensely dislikes modi and extremely skeptical his handling pulwama cannot imagine raga handling any better than modi finally has said that the alternatives are not very promising raga shitshow mamata the next most likely candidate just fascist and authoritarian modi not more most the opposition alliances only exist beat modi that the only glue holding these rivals together should they succeed that glue will dissolve and most people know this ,1

first all thank you for taking this initiative think most indians don consider ordinary pakistani citizens evil intentioned are angry your governments and the military isi establishment with that said alternative warfare facepalm recent times the government has been trying its best resume dialogue with india there the kartarpur corridor that the government really trying push hard every single time there possibility improved relations between the two countries terror attack immediately takes place probably much older you and have been seeing this pattern for long time allow present perspective pakistani you know how your military dominates the nation often said that other countries have army but pakistan the army has country the military very influential civilian government can afford against its wishes not only that the military controls pakistan foreign relations particular its policy towards india top that the military has business interests every sector your economy why does have much power because seen critical for pakistan survival seen the only thing standing between pakistan and its evil neighbour india our countries achieved lasting peace the importance pakistan military would decrease since pakistanis won consider themselves under constant threat they would question the need have such outsized and influential army budgets would reduced privileges might curtailed for the military this would loss its power and influence and that certainly won the army and the isi control the militant groups you admitted much your alternate warfare comment any time they want terror attack take place they can issue the orders and this that happens every time peace has chance the pakistani military establishment orders terror attack nip the bud 423 this evil and cynical not only that hypocritical pakistan claims represent pre 1947 india muslims frequently raises concerns about real and imaginary troubles indian muslims but carrying out terror attacks like this has only been strengthening the hands radical right wing hindutva groups pakistan has given them paintbrushes paint all muslims terrorist sympathizers has given them ammo attack liberals and centrists soft terror any indian who tries say anything positive about pakistan such considering pakistan view point labelled anti india anti national etc you are making things extremely hard for peace loving indians and extremely easy for right wing hawks trolls and goons and finally this also short sighted the age 24x7 news channels and social media outrage easy create and sustain search eyeballs and advertising revenue the channel hosts try outdo each other sensationalism and emotional hooks the result that our citizens get whipped into frenzy every time there terror attack eventually one day when there even bigger terror attack imagine 1000 dead the hysteria will much that the government would forced take military action when that happens surgical strike can escalate into war you know india has superiority conventional forces what would happen pakistan starts lose your military has already been humiliated once 1971 and another loss would completely unacceptable them they would likely use nukes against india that could easily escalate into nuclear holocaust south asia where india would severely damaged but pakistan would completely wiped out 128 ,1

 somewhat right but there are reasons don think the core members write sketches anymore they probably supervise scripts and have passed the baton new talent writers these new writers may lead sketches different direction comedy something which the old aib fans are not used someone mentioned already they have gone mainstream their first goal was recognised being edgy now that they are recognised they need expand their footprint that means pandering the common man with normal sense humour and now that they are organisation pretty sure they have legal team they consult before pushing the envelope like the roast they are responsible for the employment odd employees not just the them anymore also the conforming adviertisers part necessary evil they need the videos bring money that they can invest that into things they really love aib first draft one them mean there organisation india that appreciating new and upcoming writers like aib they are spending what estimate lakhs rupees from doing sellout videos have wait and see but one thing the group aib old fans have come terms with aib not just about the core members anymore they are giving the next gen writers chance rather than just continuing like they did which would have gotten boring too ,1

washington post after pulwama the indian media proves the bjp’ propaganda machine noredirect utm source reddit com utm term bb3fa6258d98 our investigation into the indian media’ reporting the pulwama attack found that many reports were contradictory biased incendiary and uncorroborated news organizations such india today ndtv news the indian express first post mumbai mirror ani and others routinely attributed their information anonymous “government sources ” “forensic experts ” “police officers” and “intelligence officers ” independent investigations were conducted and serious questions about intelligence failures were left unanswered once eliminated the spectacle realized that the indian public got very little information about the pulwama attack and its aftermath beyond the confusion over the death tolls balakot news organizations variously reported that between and 350 kilograms the explosive rdx was used the attack when such information was officially released reports also identified different people the supposed masterminds the pulwama attack various points without clear sourcing more than two weeks after the attack our analysis finds that news site had rectified the errors their reporting leaving these misleading facts matter public record ,1

edit this was first time expressing political view reddit should all try understand the point view the other side without animosity you can keep calling modi fenku but honestly doubt that modi cares much whether you call him fenku jhantu gandu don have keep talking about the problems our country faces guys can also part the solution here pull off trump card soldier soldier bol dia koi argument bacha nahi much hate the discomfort that this demonetization has caused think should still let bjp run the country really believe that they need more time and people need more time assess their leaders bold steps might bad like this demonetization one but bold steps are necessary for any significant change the country the propaganda around modi ridiculous but what are the alternatives are probably more informed than people living the villages and should use choose lesser the two evils also think that our media has blown things out proportion many instances love have some bold steps taken make sure that the fourth pillar democracy remains impartial criticizing government important but sensationalizing everything only going make things more and more difficult and please avoid using the bhakt title for anybody who thinks modi apt for the country this moment mud slinging only going take all further away from the opposite point view ,1

 another child the while admire your perspective and trust your facts your narrative not convincing forward movement itself given for any society when you consider years there period indian history where there hasn been forward movement over that timeframe even including the worst company rule what drives emotion the rate forward movement india share world gdp was not the lowest 1947 but 1990 just before pvn liberalization kicked when compare the rates right before and after obvious that years were wasted there also doubting that the current productivity the indian population continues stifled albeit with looser noose you assume indian identity after 1947 monolithic but think bimodal distribution closer reality the incidents goonda raj and wanton crime you mention may have occurred the hinterlands somewhere but the metros were nothing like growing sub metro part the educated middle class experienced none what you describe city bangalore was wonderful the police could trusted hell even the auto drivers were nice ask feel happy because bihar has fewer booth capturing incidents bit rich you sound like those people who ask happy because india didn turn out like the congo when know the country had everything become europe you paint overly dark picture the 1947 the 500 princely states line much bandied but little more than theatre the british provinces and the largest princely states mysore hyderabad baroda and held 250 million the 300 million inhabitants india aside from these only others even had state government the administration the country was quite robust and had been for hundred years then the prophets doom who said india would disintegrate were more credible than their descendants today who claim that india going fall apart any day now because maoists operate full india 625 districts any field from business tatas birlas cipla you know this one science the arts india was bunny 1947 there absolutely wonder that produced swaminathans krishnaswami ramaiahs and ramachandrans the wonder that there were few the examples power cuts bigger highways faster kiosks pay electricity bills like presenting figures peanut production growth and asking feel proud don recall ever thinking that powercut long queue pay the power bill was major concern and doubt you did either ,1

when was immigrating colleague who had worked previously told one thing the biggest difference between the west and india general people the west observe guidelines while indians break laws think some the reasons for this had very few opportunities and lot competition following rules meant getting left behind even have quotes glorifying this ghee seedhi ungli nikle ungli tedi karni padti hai like wtf too many movies glorifying ethically wrong things done meet end goal which just have hammered into indians that you not get any kind justice complying with the system the general lack opportunities has somehow registered people head outcome muslim appeasement reservation instead holding politicians responsible for not creating environment where there are enough opportunities around there has been rising sentiment against these two groups which actually are worse off than the rest what find scary here people who not seem have been affected this and are doing well life too seem harbor this resentment some folks seem take issue with few from these groups doing well their success always attributed facilities provided them while their own success always attributed hard work while privilege played big role the government doesn’ anything for fuck attitude hindus also feel they have been wronged socially cast setup questioned all the time they feel there are hindus being converted islam and christianity all the time hoards the numbers reflect otherwise but intuition tells them they are threat check out ted talk alan smith “why trust intuition over even the most reliable numbers ” these fears have been played big way right wing parties since the 90s and big way the last decade love jihad ghar wapsi and gau raksha are some very successful campaigns which have been launched based these fears hindus have the panchayat system… this just lets caste and religion based concepts fester everyone knows everyone there little room for people lose their identity you are always associated with your family its occupation and social standing even when someone escapes this system and moves urban setting she still associated with this setup families which have lived away from this setup for generation two still refer their original location native and refuse lose this identity ’ seen friends parents totally removed from their family’ historic occupation talk theirs for being superior while dissing someone else’ this superiority complex has carried manner where folks who were historically less well off are still not treated with respect they deserve this are better than them attitude has also morphed have remain better than them attitude too another factor introducing the any means possible attitude can keep going and with the reasons for this but bottom line indians are sentimental about all the wrong things which shouldn’ relevant anymore and this has skewed their sense what socially right underhanded approaches and violence pursued allaying their concerns are celebrated rather than condemned ",1

 think that hindus both bangladesh and pakistan should given shelter india political asylum considering the international norms providing refugee politically abused and threatened people note that modi had said indian muslims are not indians that would not have been acceptable however giving refugee and integrating religious minorities from neighboring countries seems the right thing religious majorities those countries however need use legal modes immigration they wish rather than just cross over the border squat more resources ,1
