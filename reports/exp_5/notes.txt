## ✅ Summary of Experiment Results

Lgbm,Log reg, SVM,Xgboost different combination of hyperameter where run and best result is  stored
out of these Lgbm and LogisticRegression` where found to good model 

* **Best Model**: `LogisticRegression`

  * **max\_features = 10,000**
  * **Accuracy = 0.87931**
  *  This is the **best result** in the experiment.

* **Effect of `max_features`:**

  * `max_features = 3000` → also gives **good results**, slightly below the best.
  * `max_features = 1000` → gave the **worst performance** across all runs.
